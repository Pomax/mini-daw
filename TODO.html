Transport controls:
- [ ] add a way to place the scrubber (top transport bar?)
- [ ] make play "play from scrubber" instead of from 0:0:0
- [x] relabel "stop" as "pause" since it leaves the scrubber where it is.
- [x] create real "stop" button that halts play and sets scrubber to 0:0:0

Events
- [ ] we need a way to capture pitch and mod wheel events!

Fix oscillator count:
- [ ] legato vs. polyphonic toggle, using `setTargetAtTime`?

Make time signature user-manipulable
- [x] add to settings
- [x] add HTML controls
- [ ] update piano roll to use settings
- add listeners for html controls
  - [ ] update timing wheel
  - [ ] update piano roll

Pianoroll nice to haves
- [ ] add a "quantize" option
- [ ] add a "grid resolution" picker and "snap to grid" checkbox
- [x] when click-placing notes, align to current quarter
- [ ] add note groups
  - [ ] add "control-click-drag" for selecting a bunch of notes, grouping, and then performing group-based repositioning.
  - [ ] always use note groups for repositioning, even when moving individual keys
    - [ ] only play notes when moving groups-of-one

Timing:
- [ ] let users indicate which sub-quarter tick to listen to
- [ ] checkbox for whether to play a metronome tick or not.

DONE:

- [x] update pianoroll measure/scrubber to be a background image with CSS sizing/repeat, and position notes absolutely.
- [x] make pianoroll a CSS grid
- [x] don't preallocate all MIDI key oscillators
  - [x] create them on the fly, and reuse them with `osc.frequency.value.setValueAtTime`
- [x] decommission timing wheel (T_T) in favour of mmm:qq:ffff timing information
